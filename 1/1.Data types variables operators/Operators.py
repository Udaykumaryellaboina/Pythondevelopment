Bitwise operators work on integers only.

They're often used in low-level programming, flags, networking, and optimizations'''

# Membership Operators

"""
Operator	Meaning
in	        True if value is in sequence
not in	    True if value is not in sequence

"""

#Example:


"p" in "python"    # True
10 not in [1,2,3]  # True

#Identity Operators

"""
Operator	Meaning
is	        True if both refer to same object
is not	    True if they don't

"""
#Example:

a = [1,2,3]
b = a
a is b       # True (same object)
a == b       # True (same content)

#ðŸ§  FAANG Python Interview Questions on Operators
'''ðŸ”¸ 1. What is the output of the following code?'''


a = 5
b = 2
print(a / b)
print(a // b)

#Concept: Division vs Floor Division
#Answer:

2.5     # float division
2       # floor division (drops decimal)

#ðŸ”¸ 2. What does this return and why?



print(3 < 2 < 1)

#Concept: Chained comparison
#Answer: False
#Explanation: Python evaluates it as:


'''(3 < 2) and (2 < 1) â†’ False and False â†’ False'''

#ðŸ”¸ 3. What is the output of this bitwise operation?


x = 5  # binary: 101
y = 3  # binary: 011
print(x & y)
print(x | y)
print(x ^ y)


1  # AND: 101 & 011 = 001
7  # OR : 101 | 011 = 111
6  # XOR: 101 ^ 011 = 110

#ðŸ”¸ 4. What will this code output?

x = 10
x += x - x * x
print(x)

#Concept: Operator precedence and assignment

'''x = 10 + 10 - 10 * 10 â†’ 10 + 10 - 100 = -80'''

#ðŸ”¸ 5. Explain the difference between is and == with this example:

a = 256
b = 256
print(a is b)  # ?

a = 257
b = 257
print(a is b)  # ?

True   # Interned integers (Python caches -5 to 256)
False  # Different objects (not interned)

#ðŸ”¸ 6. What is the result and why?

a = [1, 2]
b = a
a += [3, 4]
print(a)
print(b)

[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]

#Why? += on lists is in-place modification (same reference)

#ðŸ”¸ 7. What is printed here?

print(True + True)
print(True * False)


2   # True is treated as 1
0   # False is treated as 0

#ðŸ”¸ 8. How does not affect evaluation here?


x = 5
print(not x > 3)

Answer: False

#Explanation: x > 3 â†’ True â†’ not True â†’ False

#ðŸ”¸ 9. What will this print?

x = 0b1010  # 10 in binary
print(x << 2)
print(x >> 2)

40  # Left shift â†’ 101000 (adds 2 zero bits)
2   # Right shift â†’ 0010 (removes 2 bits)

#ðŸ”¸ 10. Does this raise an error?

print(10 / 0)

#Answer:
#âœ… Yes, it raises: ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

#ðŸ”¹ Bonus: Trick Question
#ðŸ”¸ 11. Predict the result

x = 1
x = x + (x == x)
print(x)

2  # Because x == x is True â†’ True = 1 â†’ x = 1 + 1 = 2
