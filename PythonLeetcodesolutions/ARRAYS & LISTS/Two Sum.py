"""1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such
that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:
•2 <= nums.length <= 104
•-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
•-109 <= target <= 109
•Only one valid answer exists."""

            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_map: #If complement is already in num_map, it means we already saw the number needed to form the target.
                return [num_map[complement], i] #Return their indices.
            num_map[num] = i #Add the current number and its index to num_map for future lookups.

result = sol.twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)

"""Step-by-Step Execution:

Initialize an empty dictionary:
num_map = {}
Start iterating over nums using enumerate:

Iteration 1:
i = 0
num = 2
complement = target - num = 9 - 2 = 7
Check: Is 7 in num_map? → ❌ No
Action: Add 2: 0 to the dictionary
num_map = {2: 0}

▶️ Iteration 2:
i = 1
num = 7
complement = 9 - 7 = 2
Check: Is 2 in num_map? → ✅ Yes, num_map[2] = 0
Action: Return [num_map[2], i] → [0, 1]

✅ Final Output:
[0, 1]
This means nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9.

🔚 Execution Ends Here (early return once the pair is found)"""

✅ Way 1: Brute Force (O(n²))
For each element nums[i], check every element to its right nums[j].
If nums[i] + nums[j] == target, return [i, j].

🔁 Dry Run:
Input:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
i = 0 → nums[0] = 2
→ j = 1 → nums[1] = 7
→ 2 + 7 = 9 ✅ → return [0, 1]

✅ Output:
[0, 1]
✅ Pros:
Simple and easy to understand
No extra memory used
❌ Cons:
Very slow for large input sizes (O(n²))

time complexity is nlogn because in this approach, the array will be first sorted and then ,
two pointer approach will be used

"""Way 2: Two Pointer Approach (O(n log n))
⚠️ Note:
This approach only works if you're allowed to sort the array and you want to return the values,
 not the original indices — unless you track the indices separately (we will!).

🔍 Logic:
Store each number with its index.
Sort based on values.
Use two pointers (left, right) to find two numbers whose sum equals target.
🔁 Dry Run:
Input:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

Create list with indices:

[(2,0), (7,1), (11,2), (15,3)]

Already sorted
Start:
left = 0 → 2
right = 3 → 15
sum = 17 ❌ → move right to 2
left = 0, right = 2 → 2 + 11 = 13 ❌
left = 0, right = 1 → 2 + 7 = 9 ✅ → return [0, 1]

✅ Output:
[0, 1]

✅ Pros:
Faster than brute force
Useful when you're working with sorted arrays or want to find pair of values, not just indices
❌ Cons:
Extra space to store original indices
Can't use it directly on LeetCode unless you preserve indices carefully"""
